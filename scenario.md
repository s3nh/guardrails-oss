## Scenario: Bank Branch - Fee Dispute

**Bank Employee:** Good morning! How can I help you today?

**Client:** Hi, I'm upset about a $35 overdraft fee on my account. I had money in savings to cover it.

**Bank Employee:** I understand your frustration. Can I have your account number to review this?

**Client:** Sure, it's 1234-5678-9012.

**Bank Employee:** I see the overdraft fee from yesterday. You're right - you did have sufficient funds in savings, but there was no automatic transfer set up between accounts.

**Client:** I thought it would transfer automatically. This seems unfair.

**Bank Employee:** I can see why this is confusing. Since you had the funds available, I'll reverse this $35 fee as a one-time courtesy. Would you like me to set up overdraft protection from your savings account?

**Client:** Yes, please. And thank you for removing the fee.

**Bank Employee:** You're welcome! The fee reversal will appear within 24 hours, and overdraft protection is now active. Is there anything else I can help you with?

**Client:** No, that covers everything. Thank you for your help.

**Bank Employee:** My pleasure. Have a great day!
